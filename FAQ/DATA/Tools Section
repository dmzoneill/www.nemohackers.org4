What does the port scaner(s) do?||There are 2 port scanners.<od_break>The first will scan a range of ports on your machine, and then return all active ones in a numeric form. Boring, and not very usful unless you no the decimal for all ports.<od_break>Scanner 2 is better as it only scans the common services, then it reports you with a description of each port and the vunreabilities each have. It's very nice :)
