Explain the search engine please!||With this search tool you can<od_break>                                      specify how many results that you want to see per page and the search<od_break>                                      depth of the search. The search depth is how many characters the<od_break>                                      search script reads of each file that it searches to look for the keyword<od_break>                                      you specify. The higher the search depth the more accurate your search<od_break>                                      will be and the slower you will get your results. The script has a<od_break>                                      timeout(actually its just that php does) of 30 seconds. So if you set the<od_break>                                      search depth of the search at 'Max' and tell it to display 'all' and you<od_break>                                      search for something that will likely be in every file then the script like<od_break>                                      likely to timeout and you not get any results at all. <od_break>                                      Anyway, this could be used as a good tool since it would search through<od_break>                                      our massive text archive for you instead of you having to do it yourself.<od_break>
