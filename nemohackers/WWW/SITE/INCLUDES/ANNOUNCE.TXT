 Nemohackers.com is back. <b>*cheers from users.</b> Nemohackers is somewhat unique now,
          as we have developed a 'school' system. You read some texts on a certain subject, then you take
                         an online test through some scripts that we have made and if you get 100%
                         then you gain 'points.' Every time you gain points a certain script goes and
                         checks to see how many points you have and then assigns you a rank in this
                         forum based on how many points you have. There are 11 ranks that require
                         between 1-100 points to get. The more points the higher the rank on the
                         boards. There will be elevated access granted based on rank and sometimes mod
                         positions in certain forums.
We are constantly in need of  'test writers', so if your interested please contact us <a href=mailto:f0d@nemohackers.com>here.</a> <br><br>
