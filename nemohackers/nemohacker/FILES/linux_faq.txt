Intro
------

I have written this mini tutorial for all users wishing to convert to Linux in the future,
who may have some doubts or sceptisizims at this time.

FAQ's
------

1. What is Linux?
===================
Like Windoze, Linux is an OS. (Operating System.) An OS is the software which runs on your
computer, allowing hardware and software applications used on your computer to communicate.
Linux is a version of the UNIX OS, which is built on Open Source Technology. This means that
the Source Code is made public, so that any programmer can make changes how ever they like, 
and then share it with other users. This open source technology has aloud distrobutions of 
Linux, such as Redhat or SuSE to make their own versions of it all with their own Target 
Audience.

2. How do i pronunce Linux?
=============================
You pronunce Linux, Lin-NUCKS.

3. Who first created Linux?
==============================
Linux was first programmed by a Finish programmer called, Linus Torvalds in 1991.

4. Ok now I know what it is, where can i get it?
================================================
Below are some of the websites for Linux Distrubutions. Although if you have a slow internet
connection, such as 56k, it is probally not such a good idea if you download 2x 650mb. I would 
recommend to these people to go and buy a Boxed Set from your local software store, of which will 
also include a manual, which is an essential for a first timer.

Redhat Linux, www.redhat.com
Calera Linux, www.caldera.com **This distro is for the developer and not a newbie**
Debian GNU,   www.debian.org
Linux Mandrake, www.linux-mandrake.com
Slackware, www.slackware.com
SuSE Linux, www.suse.com
Armed Linux Workstation, www.armed.net

These are some of the main stream distrobutions. I would recommend doing some research on each 
individual distro before you make your choice as they all have there differences.

5. So where can i get help for Linux. On the web?
=================================================
Yes, Linux is an Operating System built around communities on the web. Below are some useful 
websites which can help you in your voyage through the OS:

www.linuxdocs.org * The Linux Documentation Project. Geat Site
www.linuxnewbie.org * Nice site for the newbie.
www.linux.org 
www.linux.com
www.linuxonline.org
www.newbiesplace.cjb.net * Will help you with any computer releated problems.

6. I hear there are not many software applications availible for Linux. Is this true?
=====================================================================================
Rubbish. There are almost as much software for Linux as there is for Windoze. It's just mainly 
free so you don't see it in your high street store. www.freshmeat.net is a nice site for Linux apps, 
as is www.linuxgames.com for games. 

7. Is Linux Easy? 
===================
Linux at first will look like russian to anyone who doesn't speak it. As most of us have grown up on Windoze
we will be lost and confused, when we first see Linux. But if you read alot, and by attention you will get to
grips after a while. Altough Linux is not for the average Joe Bloggs. You must have some knowledge to get it
going.
