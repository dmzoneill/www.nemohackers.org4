1) Introduction
================
This text is writing for all Newbies, coming to Elitehackers wwwboard. There
is not one thing for frustrating than having newbies asking the same old questions
and making the same mistakes over and over again, and then the regs must correct them.
After a while this frustration turns to flaming! So before you make these mistakes read
this text, and pay attention.

2) FAQ's
=========

- Read all past posts before you post:
  90% of the time you will find answers to your question in the past posts, saving you time 
  because you won't have to wait for someone to respond. And you may not know it but the regs
  may have already answered this question, 5 or 6 times already and there patients will grow 
  increasinly scares!

- Posting in the appropiate forum:
  Before you post your message make sure you post it in the correct forum. And unless you have
  reason don't post your question in more than one forum because if they want to answer it, they will.

- If you are looking for a crack or serial number:
  Now, there is a Warez forum for this. But before you do check:  http://astalavista.box.sk and
  http://www.northernlight.com. 9 out 10 times they will have what you are looking for.

- Why do you get awards?:
  OK, you get awards for very helping posts, good ideas etc..

- What do the stars mean. And can I have a Gold One?
  The stars reflect your number of posts. You will get a when you get 100 posts i think. 2    golds at 150 etc..

- Do not ask general Questions:-
  Don't ask general things like "how do I hack?", say what you want to hack and exactly what your problem is.

- Never ask: How do I hack hotmail?
  This is the worst of all questions. Read the following:
  Hotmail belongs to Microsoft. Hotmail runs Microsoft software. Microsoft is the first to hear 
  about any exploits. Microsoft.com, Windows.net and Hotmail.com are the first sites in the world 
  that get patched, even before e.g. NASA and other .gov sites.So it's not a simple task, it's Mission 
  Impossible III, and that's why nobody even bothers to answer these questions any more, since they are 
  asked daily. - Thanks to Zerovince for that.

- Don't ask for a mentor.
  There is line between asking questions and having a mentor. You will have to learn things yourself and
  use your common sense. Review previous posts to help you learn, read texts, www.newbiesplace.cjb.net.

- Don't beg and bug people.
  OHHHH PLEASE PRETTY PLEASE HELP ME! Come on guys, this is not gonna get you anywhere. It is nothing more than
  anonying. The best way to get the answer you want is to be poliete!

- Over use of CAPS!
  Typing messages in CAPS lock will annoy people and make messages very very hard to read. They are not nessercery
  and will not useually get you anywhere.

- Think twice
  Think twice before doing your actions.

Anyway just pay attention. fod@q3arena.com
