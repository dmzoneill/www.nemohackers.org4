*** Okay now, This didn't originally include what an IP is, but I thought that I would add it as 

B1nary is doing homework! lol.

Every computer which is on a network, (Packet Switched) has an IP. These are based on the TCP/IP 

protocol. An IP address is needed to identify a computer. 

An IP is also essential in the relay and routing of data successfully.

** So now that I know what an IP is. How is it structured?

It will have two fields:

1). The first is the network address: This is automatically assigned by InterNIC.(Internet 

Network Information Center). Currently ISP by a range and distribute them to individual users.

2). The second is the station address. Assigned to you be the system administrator.  Thats a 

brief description of the structure of an IP. R a v e N wrote; an in depth tutorial on it at 

BlackSun, so for further reading I recommend it. (www.newbiesplace.cjb.net)


** IP Sniffing **

There's several ways of going about this.

1). You can get a direct connection through ICQ, open up your MS-DOS (Microsoft Disc Operating 

System) Prompt, found by clicking start and going to programs.  Type in Netstat -n this will give 

you a list of hosts which you are currently connected to.

2). Finding out, which IP is your victims, is pretty easy.  All you need to do is find out which 

port your messenger or whatever is running on, and find it under the "Foreign Address" column in 

Netstat.  Say, for example, ICQ runs on port 1024, you find the foreign IP on that port, and bang, 

there you go.

*Remember: You'll need to get a direct connection with a user before you can find their IP.  MSN 

and AOL run through proxies, so you'll need to establish a direct connection by uploading 

something to them or whatever. (At least I think this will work, I haven't really tried it yet.) 

Or if you would rather not get your hands dirty and go into DOS, you could get a common Trojan 

called SubSeven (http://www.newbiesplace.cjb.net) and that includes a program which will convert 

UIN's (ICQ numbers) into IP addresses.  Handy if you don't want to let them know you are about, 

or if you are timed in DOS.

*** Okay, a few other sneaky ways of getting IP addresses if your prey is a moron.

1). Ask him to click start, click run, and type in WINIPCFG, then tell him/her to give you the IP 

address, make something up like, "I need it for a science/technology project."  Just something 

dumb, and simple.

2). Ask them to go to http://www.whatismyip.com and tell you what the big number is, hehe.  I 

forgot to mention; if you're in a chat like IRC (Internet Relay Chat) you can simply type 

/dns personsnamehere and their IP will appear in your status window if you have a client such as

mIRC (http://www.mirc.com).


** Pinging **

	After you get an IP address you can ping it.  This works better than a nuker because, 

well, it actually works sometimes.  Nukers are old and outdated by about 5 years or so, so most 

of them don't work.  Open up a MS-DOS Prompt and if you're just curious about different ping 

commands and what they do type Ping -?  And for Netstat, type Netstat -?

Now, with the IP address type in Ping -l xxx.xx.xx.xx (the x's being the variables for the IP) 

and hit enter.  This will ping and/or send packets to the specified user; in turn it slows down 

and may possibly even disconnect their Internet connection.  Pinging and crap is kind of lame, 

but hey, the net gets boring, some people are annoying and you just need something to do.  


** Sniffing a Server **


Most of this tutorial has been about sniffing the IP of a personal Computer. Lets go further now.

If you wish to learn the IP address of a server, it's simple. But remember that the IP address of 

a server is usually Static. (Meaning that it is always the same, whereas a 'Dynamic' address, 

commonaly with Dial ups, always change when you log on).  So you have the URL of a site. Say, 

www.host.com - Now you need to resolve this to an IP.  There are many ways of resolving this. 

One is a DNS resolver which comes with many cracking tools, such as Access Driver 

(www.newbiesplace.cjb.net). 

That will return the address of www.host.com to an IP such as: 64.156.187.1  This is your 

address. If you wish to get fancy you could always go to your MS-DOS prompt and type: 

ping www.host.com that will also return the IP of the host.

We hope that this tutorial has been of some assistance to those of you who have read it.  If you

day and God bless!
