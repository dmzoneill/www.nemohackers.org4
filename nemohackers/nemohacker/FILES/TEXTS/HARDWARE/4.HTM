<BR>This page should be read together with modules 2a, 2b, 2c, and 2d, which 
deal with system board, system bus, I/O bus and chip sets. When we talk about 
motherboard and chip sets, we cannot ignore RAM. Warning: RAM and RAM chips is a 
very complicated, technical subject area. I can in no way give a complete, 
comprehensive description of this subject. But, here you can read a little

<DIV class=igen>RAM is our working memory storage. All the data, which the PC 
uses and works with during operation, are stored here. Data are stored on 
drives, typically the hard drive. However, for the CPU to work with those data, 
they must be read into the working memory storage, which is made up of RAM 
chips. To examine RAM, we need to look at the following: 
<UL>
  <LI>RAM types (FPM, EDO, ECC, and SD RAM) 
  <LI>RAM modules (SIMM and DIMM) in different versions 
  <LI>RAM and the system bus </LI></UL>First, let us look back in time. Not too 
many years ago, Bill Gates said, that with 1 MB RAM, we had a memory capacity, 
which would never be fully utilized. That turned out to be untrue. 
<H3>Historical review</H3>Back in the 80s, PCs were equipped with RAM in 
quantities of 64 KB, 256 KB, 512 KB and finally 1 MB. Think of a home computer 
like Commodore 64. It had 64 KB RAM, and it worked fine. 
<P>Around 1990, advanced operating systems, like Windows, appeared on the 
market, That started the RAM race. The PC needed more and more RAM. That worked 
fine with the 386 processor, which could address larger amount of RAM. The first 
Windows operated PCs could address 2 MB RAM, but 4 MB soon became the standard. 
The race has continued through the 90s, as RAM prices have dropped dramatically. 

<P>Today. it would be foolish to consider less than 32 MB RAM in a PC. Many have 
much more. 128 MB is in no way too much for a "power user" with Windows 95/98, 
it is important with plenty of RAM. Click here to read about the <A 
href="http://www.mkdata.dk/click/module6b.htm">swap file </A>and RAM 
considerations. Windows 98 is a little better at handling memory, but still a 
lot af RAM is a good thing.

<DIV class=igen>The traditional RAM type is DRAM (<I>dynamic </I>RAM). The other 
type is SRAM (<I>static </I>RAM). SRAM continues to remember its content, while 
DRAM must be refreshed every few milli seconds. DRAM consists of micro 
capacitors, while SRAM consists of off/on switches. Therefore, SRAM can respond 
much faster than DRAM. SRAM can be made with a <I>rise time</I> as short as 4 
ns. It is used in different versions in L2 cache RAM (for example <I>pipe line 
Burst Cache SRAM</I>). 
<P>DRAM is by far the cheapest to build. Newer and faster DRAM types are 
developed continuously. Currently, there are at least four types: 
<UL>
  <LI>FPM (<I>Fast Page Mode</I>) 
  <LI>ECC (<I>Error Correcting Code</I>) 
  <LI>EDO (<I>Extended Data Output</I>)

<DIV class=igen>FPM was the traditional RAM for PCs, before the EDO was 
introduced. It is mounted in SIMM modules of 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 MB. Typically, 
it is found in 60 ns or 70 ns versions. 60 ns is the fastest and the one to use. 
You cannot mix different speeds on the same Pentium motherboard. 
<P><A name=EDO></A>EDO is an improvement of FPM RAM. Data are read faster. By 
switching from FPM to EDO, one can expect a performance improvement of 2 to 5 
percent. EDO RAM are usually sold in 60 ns versions. A 50 ns version is 
available at higher cost. 
<P><A name=ECC></A>ECC RAM is a special error correcting RAM type. It is 
especially used in servers. 
<P><A name=SDRAM></A>SDRAM is the newest RAM type for PCs. It comes only in 64 
bit modules (long 168 pin DIMMs). SDRAM has a access time of only 8-12 ns. The 
performance improvement over EDO RAM is only 5 percent running at 66 MHz, but at 
100 MHz it will prove a lot better. 
<P>RAMBUS (RDRAM) is a future RAM type. Intel and others have great expectations 
from this type. 
<P>
<H3>8 or 9 bits per byte?</H3>Normally you figure 8 bits to one byte. For many 
years, a ninth bit has been added as <I>parity</I> bit in the RAM blocks to 
verify correct transmission. That way you have to transmit 9 bits, to store 8 
bits in the old 30 pin RAM chips. And it takes 36 bits to store 32 bits in the 
larger 72 pin chips, which increases the cost of the RAM chip by about 12%. 
<P>If your motherboard requires 36 bit modules, you must respect that. 
Fortunately, most system boards accepts 32 bit modules, so this creates no 
problems.

<DIV class=igen>You cannot freely install your desired RAM type. RAM is 
controlled by the chip set on the motherboard, so you must install a type, which 
matches your motherboard. Furthermore, RAM chips come in different sizes, which 
must match the system board. 
<P>On modern system boards, RAM is installed on SIMM or DIMM modules. Before, 
small individual DRAMs were used. There was usually room for 36 small chips on 
the system board. That made it cumbersome to install new RAM. Then, someone 
figured out to install RAM chips on cards, which are easily installed. First 
came the SIPP modules. They had multiple pins, which fit in the motherboard. 
Since then came the SIMM modules. They are mounted on a card, which has an edge 
connector. They fit in sockets on the motherboard, and anyone can install them.

<DIV class=igen>SIMM modules were first made in 8 bit editions. They were small 
cards with 1, 2 or 4 MB RAM. They were connected to the motherboard with a 30 
pin edge connector. The modules were 8 bit wide. This meant that 16 bit 
processors (286 and 386SX) needed 2 SIMMs in a pair. Thus, there was room for 
two modules in what is called a <I>bank</I>. 
<P>32 bit processors (386DX and 486) need 4 of the small 8 bit SIMMs in a bank, 
since their banks are 32 bit wide. So, on a typical 1st generation 486 
motherboard, you could install 4 X 1 MB, 4 X 2 MB, or 4 X 4 MB in each bank. If 
you only had one bank (with room for 4 modules), it was expensive to increase 
the RAM, because you had to discard the old modules. 
<P>
<HR>

<H3>32 bit modules</H3>With the advent of the 486 processor, demand increased 
for more RAM. Then the larger 32 bit modules came into use. A 486 motherboard 
could still have 4 SIMM sockets, but when the modules were 32 bit wide, they 
could be installed one at a time. This was quite ingenious. You could add 
different types of modules and still use the old ones. Also, since the 486 
motherboard ran at only 33 MHz on the system bus, the RAM module quality was not 
so critical. You could mix 60 ns and 70 ns modules of different brands without 
problems. 
<P>Here you see a couple of SIMM modules. On top is a 64 bit module (168 pins - 
don't try to count them). Next is a 32 bit module with a 72 pin connector. Below 
is an 8 bit module with a 30 pin connector:

<DIV class=igen>Some SIMMs have more chips on the module than others. Looking at 
just the 32 bit modules, we find modules with 2, 4, 8 or chips on each side. 
SIMMs with 2 MB, 8 MB and 32 MB are double sided. There are chips on both sides 
of the module, and all these chips are 16 Mbit ones. 
<P>The newest DIMM-modules holds 64 Mbit RAM chips. This way a 32 MB module is 
made of only 4 chips since 4 X 64 / 8 = 32. 
<H3>Pentium motherboard with SIMMs</H3>On the Pentium motherboard, the system 
bus is 64 bit wide. Therefore, the 32 bit SIMMs are installed in pairs. Since 
the standard motherboard only has two banks with a total of four SIMM sockets, 
RAM expansion possibilities are limited. NOTE: never use different speed RAM 
modules on the Pentium motherboard. All modules <I>must </I>have the same speed. 
Here you see a few configurations on an old Pentium motherboard with four SIMM 
sockets:

<DIV class=igen>The next RAM type, SDRAM are made in 64 bit wide modules called 
DIMMs. They have a 168 pin edge connector. They fit only in the newer 
motherboards. 
<P>Since the DIMM modules are 64 bits wide, you can install one module at a 
time. They are available in 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 and 256 MB, with 6, 8, 10, and 12 
ns speed. There are usually three DIMM sockets on a motherboard. 
<P>The advantage of SDRAM is increased speed. That allows you to increase system 
bus speed. With 60 ns EDO-RAM, you can run at a maximum of 75 MHz on the system 
bus, while SDRAM speed can increase to at least 100 MHz. Also the SDRAM work 
synchronous with the system bus for a better performance. 
<P>All new chip sets can control SDRAM. Some motherboards have both SIMM and 
DIMM sockets. The idea is that you can choose between re use EDO RAM in the SIMM 
sockets, or install SDRAM in the DIMM sockets. They are not designed to mix RAM 
types although it works at some boards.

<DIV class=igen>Intel have managed to speed up the processors power by factor 
200 times the last ten years. That is a lot, but it is a problem that RAM memory 
technology only has improved by factor 20 in the same period. 
<P>Today we hope and dream of new fast RAM types, that will help us to get the 
full potential from our powerful PCs. 
<H3>PC100 RAM</H3>
<DIV class=igen>The first attempt to improving RAM speed was the PC100 standard. 
With chip sets like <A href="http://www.mkdata.dk/click/module2d4.htm#bx">BX</A> 
the system bus speed has come up to 100 MHz. Hence Intel has made a new standard 
called PC100. Only 8 ns SD-RAM modules that are constructed according to these 
standards are guaranteed to work at 100 MHz. In some articles this RAM is 
described at 125 SD-RAM. 
<H3>SPD</H3>
<P>The new DIMM-modules include a EPROM-chip holding information about the 
module. This little 8-pin chip works as a SPD (<I>Serial Presence Detect</I>) - 
a unit storing information about the RAM type. The idea is that BIOS can read 
this information and this way tune the system bus and the timings for a perfect 
CPU-RAM performance. 
<P>You can find a program, that tests the centents of the SPD at this <A 
href="http://www.ix.de/ct/english/98/18/036/" target=_blank>c't homepage</A>. It 
works with the Intel chip sets holding a 82371 south bridge like BX and GX. 
<P>
<H3>PC133</H3>The PC133 RAM running at 133 MHz is comming soon. Specifications 
are made by VIA, Micron, NEC, Samsung, SIS, Acer Labs and other vendors. The 
first production (from Corsair, June 1999) uses 7.5 ns RAM modules from Micron. 
<P>VIA supports the PC133 RAM with a new version of their <A 
href="http://www.mkdata.dk/click/module2d4.htm#apollo">Apollo Pro Plus</A> chip 
set (693A). Later they expect to launche support for PC266 DDR RAM! Intel 
<P>should be planning a BX2 chip set, which also supports PC133 RAM. Also <A

ready for PC133 RAM in some versions.

<DIV class=igen>While the CPUs has become around 200 times faster in ten years, 
the RAM performance has only gone up 20 times. So we need new RAM types. But 
which? 
<P>
<H3>Rambus (and Intel)</H3>Intel expects soon to use the so-called Rambus RAM 
(RDRAM or nDRAM). It is a advanced technology from an American company, who 
sells the technology to other chip manufactories for a 2% in license. AMD also 
support the new RAM type for its K7 Athlon processor. 
<P>RDRAM is developed from the traditional DRAM, but the architecture has been 
streamed and optimized to yield new performance. Data is read in packets at a 
very high clock speed. 
<P>The modules are only 16 bit wide, but they work at 800 MHz, and GigaHertz 
will probably follow. All RAM slots have to be full; this is new, with RAMBUS we 
have to fill in blank modules in slots which are not in use.
<P>The RDRAM chips have to be placed very close to the CPU to reduce radio 
noise. 
<P>In May 1999 it seems that Intel is having problems with the Rambus 
technology. Hence they should be planning to support PC133 RAM as a temporary 
solution. 
<H3>DDRAM</H3>
<P>Another interesting RAM type is the DDR RAM (not that DDR). DDR stands for 
Double Data Rate: a technology that transmits data on both sides of a tact 
signal. DDR-SDRAM is getting more and more hot. All major vendors except Intel 
support DDR-SDRAM. DDR-SDRAM will to be cheaper than Rambus RAM yet giving the 
same (or better) performance.
