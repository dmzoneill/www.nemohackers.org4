``xGet ready for 'Code Red' worm version 2.0 <br><br>By Jon Swartz, USA TODAY <br><br>SAN FRANCISCO &#8212; The fast-moving "Code Red" Internet worm could squirm into 6 million more computers starting Tuesday night, slowing the Internet. The worm, which infected more than 350,000 computers 2 weeks ago, isn't a direct threat to consumers. But it could hamper or shut down business Web sites by bombarding them with data. "Code Red poses a distinct threat to the Internet," says Ron Dick, head of the FBI's National Infrastructure Protection Center. <br>The FBI held a very rare cybernews conference Monday to issue a Code Red warning and highlight concern over worms that are increasingly disrupting the Internet. The FBI doesn't know the origin of Code Red. <br><br>The worm, named after an ultra-caffeine version of a soft drink, first surfaced in a July 19 attack on the White House Web site that was largely rebuffed. The worm infected some of Microsoft's computers and some of Cisco System's Internet software and forced the Pentagon to temporarily block public access to its Web sites. <br><br>Computers running windoze NT, windoze 2000 and Microsoft's Internet Information Server software are vulnerable. Those running windoze 98, windoze 95 and windoze Me are less vulnerable, experts say. <br><br>Code Red, dangerous because of its ability to spread so quickly, defaces Web sites with the phrase "Hacked by Chinese." It does not destroy data. Unlike most worms, it doesn't travel via e-mail: It installs itself on server computers, which then are instructed to blitz Web sites with data. <br><br>Online users could face delays the next 24 to 48 hours, depending on which Web servers and which host Web sites are hit, says Vincent Gullotto, an anti-virus expert at software maker McAfee. <br><br>Technicians are quickly blocking the worm with a software patch available on Microsoft's Web site at www.microsoft.com/security. Unless consumers use computers to run Web sites, no action is recommended. So far, 1 million copies of the patch have been downloaded. "There shouldn't be panic in the streets," says David Perry at software maker Trend Micro. <br><br>Consumers aren't completely immune to viruses, however. An e-mail virus called SirCam is spreading online. It has infected tens of thousands of personal computers since popping up 2 weeks ago. <br><br>Code Red won't go away, either. It spreads over the first 19 days of a month, attacks for 9 and goes to sleep until the next month.<br>``xtvwize``xtvwize@nemohackers.com``xNotice``x996794890,15198,``x``x
